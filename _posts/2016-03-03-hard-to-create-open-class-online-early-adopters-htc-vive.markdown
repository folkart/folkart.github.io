![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1586/25347965892_2c3cfb2f45_b.jpg)Vivo Yu recently released has new flagship Xplay5 series phone, Xplay5 used has double surface screen + integration metal fuselage of design, appearance quite stunning, and used has vivo new of HiFi 3.0 system, consider to past VIVO in audio aspects of excellent performance, we undoubtedly on Xplay5 of sound has is high of looks forward to, now on please followed we of footsteps view see vivo super strong sound of mystery in where\'s.PS:vivo structure of Xplay5 is complex, many parts after disassembling it is difficult to restore, normal users don\'t try.![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1524/25440263676_78e5648e0d_b.jpg)Before starting dismantling remember to pull out the SIM slot.

Back to Vivo after the usual metal one-piece cover, inside back cover and no injection before NFC antennas, Xplay5 may be tantamount to NFC functionality.![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1650/25098907769_3e541eec37_b.jpg)Circuit design for preparing Board + battery + Vice design.![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1709/24835917384_efee024f67_b.jpg)Press-type fingerprint recognition is installed on the rear cover, through the contacts connected to the Board, and simplifies rear cover removal easier.![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1652/25466484795_6eee6dd7a5_b.jpg)Batteries by double sided tape to stick in the box, need heating + paddles removed it.![Alt \rHard to create open class Online--early adopters HTC Vive](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1443/25440341966_d011c819fb_b.jpg)First disconnect the handset battery cable. Vivo metal bezel + all lines are used to screw and prevents lines caused by shaking loose.Battery lithium-ion polymer battery 3600mAh for.All lines including cameras are fixed with a metal barrier, we have removed one by one.In order to facilitate separation boards, our speakers all Vice and metal bezel removed, then, including the screen cable cable, coaxial cable separation, any further disassembly.Speakers, USB interface and the vibration motors in the SubPanel.Board can then be taken down and the Board is covered with a metal shield, basically no bare chips.Boards likewise covered with a metal shield on the back and a single block of copper foil cover on top of the shield, for enhanced chip cooling.Remove the motherboard we camera can be removed. Xplay 5 rear-facing camera for 16 million pixels, using the Sony IMX298 sensor, lens aperture of F2.0 and no optical image stabilization. Front of 8 million, there is close in size.After we will Board copper foil on the back of open, you can see a large area of the metal shielding enclosures, apply thermal conductivity for SoC+ Flash memory chips. So many metal shielding enclosures should be for HiFi systems designed to reduce mutual interference between chips.Xplay5 shielding all use solder soldering on the motherboard, we use a heat gun to heat after it removed one by one. [Cath Kidston galaxy note 4](http://www.nixcase.com/cath-kidston-samsung-galaxy-note-4-case-rose-blue-p-4535.html)Remove the most shield you can see specific models of each chip.Most visible on the back of the motherboard Samsung 0BMFGCF-K30F4F4 LPDDR3L memory chip capacity is 4GB, the following package Gao Tongxiao Dragon 652, 4 Cortex-A72 and 4 Cortex-A53, comprise a 28nm HPM technology, matching Adreno 510 graphics processor.Another piece of relatively large size is a THGBMHG9C8LBAIG from Toshiba Flash chips, 15nm process, meet the eMMC 5.1 specification, capacity of 128GB.Next and finally to the audio chip, the CS4398CN DAC from Cirrus Logic chip. CS4398CN is the top of the Cirrus Logic decoding chip, the fine disc supports 24 bit/192kHz decoding, SNR 120dB distortion -107dB, was a classic example of a DAC chip, VIVO for adjusting the chip experience.CS4398CN next 51AP8LI ADC3001 audio chip from Texas instruments.PM8004 power management chip from Qualcomm.Qualcomm chip PM8956 PMIC (power management integrated circuits).Qualcomm chip PMI8952 PMIC (power management integrated circuits).Qualcomm WTR2965 RF chip.Skyworks 77824-11 RF power amplifier. (FDD LTE)Skyworks 77629-21 RF power amplifiers. ( GSM EDGE WCDMA HSDPA)Vivo served final dismantling of the Xplay5 family.[![Alt Cath Kidston galaxy note 4](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/note4/cath_kidston_n4409_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nixcase.com/cath-kidston-samsung-galaxy-note-4-case-rose-blue-p-4535.html) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNA_SHgPb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNA_SHgPb8) Judging from the dismantling, Xplay5 continues the Vivo\'s excellent work, motherboard design is very neat, almost all chips are covered by the shield and heating large processor + memory chip part using the auxiliary heat sink thermal grease + copper foil, also have specialized metals at the cable bezel fixed material is conscience. Used surface screen + back cover metal design, compact structure is fairly rigorous. As the first dual-surface screen + full metal body frame of China-made mobile phones, VIVO Xplay5 not only has a beautiful appearance, there is a pretty solid interior design, is called both inside and outside.4 votesVivo Xplay5\rVivo launched two years ago developed new flagship \"Xplay5\", including the Xplay5 flagship, Xplay5 two versions, the biggest selling point is without doubt: first 6GB memory, made the world\'s first hyperboloid side screen. Xplay5 is an integrated metal special aluminum-magnesium alloy body, metal up to 98% per cent, champagne gold, rose gold, two color schemes.\rView details of the voting >>
