Consumer drones while it\'s still not up to the \"universal\" level, but its shape seems to have been fixed, like smart phones as the homogenization of serious, \"axis\" seems to be the drone in the standard, and dominated the field of RC airplane fixed wing until it became \"infidels\". At this year\'s CES Consumer Electronics Show, old pioneer drone Parrot has a \"four-axis Orthodox\" pressure has introduced a fixed-wing drone--Parrot Disco, just Parrot today officially announced, Disco will go on sale next month, priced at 1299 €.[![Alt VR Shinecon virtual reality headset](http://www.everweek.com/images/large/virtual_reality/vrshinecon_vr006_lrg.jpg)](http://www.everweek.com/vr-shinecon-virtual-reality-headset-for-smart-phone-p-2840.html)![Alt Senior reading Parrot fly hand fixed-wing drones: expensive! But pioneering! | A new intellectual](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8408/30231600516_346b9201b4_b.jpg)Fixed-wing UAVs for aerial is indeed a novelty, more so is Parrot the industry\'s status and reputation has been recognized by many people, so news came out of the Disco was launched, raises the industry discussion group, Lei Feng also found a few industry people talk about their view of the drone.I am x, it\'s a bit expensive!1299 euro into RMB 10,000 yuan, coupled with tariffs, fees broken seven or eight bad things, the price is not too friendly.A senior UAV ridicule players from Lei Feng network, said the price did some not too close to the people, not to discuss his technology, research and development, materials and other costs, but from the position, in addition to RC airplane enthusiast, few ordinary users would spend more than 10,000 to buy a \"toy\".Yes, in addition to the toys I really can\'t think of this drone can do, aerial photography? Fixed-wing aerial is of little value, it cannot hover, a direct flights have been flying it, wanted to make a stable picture is difficult. Moreover, the price to buy a professional aerial machine shouldn\'t be a problem, right? Frontier spirit 4 is 9,000.Lei Feng network (search \"Lei Feng network\" public, concern) to Parrot official website view has about they past products of price, most your of a paragraph no machine Bebop 2 also but 549 euro, and Disco this paragraph new products is is former of twice times more than, this from end a jump to high-end of impression, does let habits Parrot \"partial toy\" impression of old players hard accept.![Alt Senior reading Parrot fly hand fixed-wing drones: expensive!

[VR Shinecon virtual reality headset](http://www.everweek.com/vr-shinecon-virtual-reality-headset-for-smart-phone-p-2840.html)I am x, do you know how much space is hard to find?Beijing banned everywhere, not to mention fixed-wing, wanted to play a little four-axis, have to sit for an hour or two of the car, ran to come all this way to fly, Parrot Disco 80 km per hour, a school playground has hundreds of meters in diameter, flew out to seconds seconds.![Alt Senior reading Parrot fly hand fixed-wing drones: expensive! But pioneering! | A new intellectual](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5477/29635939254_08b51db197_b.jpg)Due to the rapid development of drones and the perfection of relevant laws and regulations, the relevant government departments of UAV ground control has become ever tougher, for unmanned aerial vehicles, model player, wanted to find a suitable fixed-wing drones flying around, but also be able to fly where cool is really not an easy thing.I saw the introduction of Parrot Disco, this UAV with or connected WiFi + Skycontroller remote control, Parrot official known as the most distant control up to two kilometres, but this is just a data, really depends on the control of environmental conditions, and in case some interference, at a distance of hundreds of metres, bolt is not impossible. 10,000 step back and say, even stable line, Disco the control distance is 2 km, but its maximum speed of 80 km/h, flying two miles a minute, and, no one can guarantee that a user with a FPV playing helmet high, forget the lost distance leads to fly. Points lost such a big fly in the mountains, at most any economic losses (economic loss is not small), if flying in the city lost, dropped down to hit the vehicle may be in trouble.My x, I suddenly feel though they Parrot the AH!Disadvantages of ridicule a bunch of Parrot Disco, the slow response of the players above this sentence.Although this machine I don\'t like, but Parrot this line of thinking could have said.The no machine players told Lei Feng network, now no machine market although close saturated has, but Xia to subdivision of all field, are also has opportunities, and now no machine of competition basically are concentrated in has more axis No machine Shang, with quality of is serious, and in fixed wing no machine this aspects, to now also didn\'t appeared a like big Xinjiang, and Parrot such of company, so this field also is has gaotou of.Drones circle players used to say, Xinjiang lowering the threshold of the UAV, but until now, the threshold is, especially fixed-wing model aircraft, no technology at all playing well. Parrot Disco may occur is to lower the threshold fixed-wing drones.Parrot official said Disco is the first without having to learn to be able to start the fixed-wing drones, its automatic steering system and a variety of sensors (accelerometers, Gyros, magnetometer, barometer, pitot tubes, GPS) able to control the flight. Controls are easy to take off landing, according to the official description: take off, players need on the plane and on the remote control button actions, like Frisbee throwing Disco took off into the air. After takeoff, the Parrot Disco will automatically go up to 50 meters away from the overhead, waiting for the player to the next instruction. On landing the same remote control operation, Parrot Disco would then tilt flap and down to 6 meters high off the ground. At this point, the drones will be received from the altimeter, Ultrasonic sensors and the camera information, UAV motors will then provide reverse thrust to slow down to ensure smooth drones leaning over land.This is much simpler than when we play RC airplane. Hand thrown to take off completely is not a fresh guy, generations of models who are so fun. But hand throw is a skill, not throw you can fly, Disco made it easy. If this product of fashion, who will open the market of fixed-wing, as a leader, I think the Parrot in this perspective is a great chance.![Alt Senior reading Parrot fly hand fixed-wing drones: expensive!

Also, introduce, Parrot wing fixed \"threshold\" is reduced. Despite some inevitable shortcomings, but these are not going to change the flawed, fixed-wing after the consumer drones how depends on the development strategy and market reaction. The industry believes that fixed-wing consumer drones did not do it to anyone, but on the sidelines, the market good or bad it\'s hard to say and do such a small white players can play fixed-wing drones, both in research and development, promoting face challenge.Classic line says good: rather than feeling way too difficult, than to start at once. Parrot Disco success leading a new trend is hard to say, but this new attempt is to be encouraged.
