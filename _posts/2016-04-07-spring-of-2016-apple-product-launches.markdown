Meizu published in the April 6 new Conference was a blue Note3, EP51 and other products, which is undoubtedly the focus of everyone\'s attention, what is the actual performance? ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1589/26255643226_5948801f0b_b.jpg)Note3 charm blue packaging with white tray design, packaging of positive product naming. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1577/25678858273_1c233aeab3_b.jpg)Information on product packaging back, we got the silver 16G Sample, that is, with low price 799 Yuan. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1625/26189151902_f70cb37f64_b.jpg)Opened the package on the first floor you can see mobile phones, mobile phone there is a protective film front. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1538/26189156322_bd0ed64607_b.jpg)Take away your cell phone, the second layer is the card PIN, modelling is a Flyme logo, this and the previous product is the same.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1613/26215344101_5db7b26437_b.jpg)Is rather special, kazhen paper and instructions are one and the same. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1585/26215356181_412bf60807_b.jpg)Cell phone accessories are simple, data cable, power adapter and PIN, data estimation is limited to the cost of not using the Type-C interface, power adapter not support high voltage fast charge, charge standard 5V 2 a. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1627/25678887613_2d86e24942_b.jpg)Charm blue Note3 obvious Meizu product family features positive, positive there is no logo, with the home key of an entity. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1580/26008746610_2c67e4420d_b.jpg)Left and right sides of the receiver are the front-facing camera and distance sensor/light, using a symmetrical shape, slightly cute, can be seen from here, magic blue Note3 \"forehead\" more lenient. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1582/26215370281_03d3ff359f_b.jpg)Home key charm blue Note3 entities with press-type fingerprint recognition, mTouch and mBack function, that Meizu phone \"standard\" functions. Keys without loosing, feel hard and tight, elastic a bit poor. ![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1706/26281632515_19cc3630cf_b.jpg)Charm blue Note3 2.5D front panel glass, flat edge curvature, the human touch of a change is not significant. But something is better than nothing, and friends of Meizu in the release slot\'s flagship product, service provider to cancel the 2.5D front panel glass design (no accident is always the millet 5). Volume button and the power button on the right side of the phone. Phone card slot on the left side, supporting two nanoSIM cards, and the use of \"Cato\" design, a card which supports nanoSIM TF card, supports up to 128G capacity expansion. Charm blue Note3 support China Netcom, and two cards are supported on a telecommunications card (that is, the so-called \"blind\"). Function of the card slot is almost perfect, but Cato workmanship is a little rough. MicroUSB connector at the bottom of the fuselage, there are four holes on each side around and is very symmetrical, actually left the microphone on the right speaker. Back uses 6000 series aluminum-magnesium alloy lid, and MX5, PRO5 products look very similar, with family characteristics. But back only the middle section of the fuselage was metal, injection molding on each side, carefully looks a little color. Post 13 million with phase focus camera, dual color led fill light, which is the price of mobile phone comparison \"standard\" set of configuration.From the looks, charm blue Note3 can only say great, 4100mAh battery configuration, however maintaining 8.2 mm and 163 g, controlled fairly well. Phone no ultra narrow frame design, with rounded body, gives the grip will be plump, single hand held a little pressure. Charm blue Note3 Meizu sign Flyme 5 system, uses and other Meizu cell phones without any gaps. By press time the system version is a Flyme 5.1.3.0A, Android-based 5.1 System. Fast switching of the dropdown bar still has 12 squares. [Kenzo case iPhone 6](http://www.nodcase.com/kenzo-iphone-6-case-field-flowers-p-4148.html) Pull up in the left corner of the phone, you can bring up the multitasking menu, the \"all off\" shortcut button placed at the top makes it difficult to understand. Charm blue Note3 uses mediatek new Helio P10, MT6752 relative to the past, using more advanced technology, and bring their own base-band, has an advantage in terms of both power and cost. Specific charm blue Note3 using model MT6755m low frequency version, CPU is the eight-core Cortex-A53, is a combination of 4+4, the frequency is 1.8GHz+1.0GHz. This combination than on a single-core performance MT6752 (eight-core 1.7GHz) better multi-core performance may be even worse. MT6755m the CPU performance is also significantly lower than the charm on a blue Metal MT6795m. [![Alt Kenzo case iPhone 6](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/kenzo_i6_case_i61204_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/kenzo-iphone-6-case-field-flowers-p-4148.html)While the GPU using Mali-T860mp2 550MHz, actual performance we needed more testing before we can judge. On the OPPO R9 Mali-T860mp2 Mali-T760mp2 on the 700MHz is better than MT6752, but not as charming PowerVR G6200 550MHz on a blue Metal. [Kenzo tiger iPhone 6 case](http://moschino6.tumblr.com/post/140512871205/mac-pc-makers-should-not-underestimate) We also desire blue Note3 CPU frequency monitoring and testing, and can be seen under the Starter has only three big nuclear opened frequency is very low. And to third-party applications, frequency slightly positive but also just have three big nuclear core full-frequency operation (open performance when test mode). Charm can be seen blue Note3 a set-up to control power consumption in the CPU\'s core open frequencies were very negative, and the official super long battery life estimates and the set-up of the CPU has a lot to do. And judging from the actual fluency, charm blue Note3 not very smooth multitasking menu popup significantly drop frames, you can understand the part for Meizu to life at the expense of performance. And some need more threads to run projects, charm blue Note3 was not so \"miserly\", and finally eight-core fully open, and this premise is certainly on performance mode. Probably because the system is still in testing phase, charming blue Note3 after lock screen and automatically returns to standard mode of operation, required performance mode to reset the time to take effect, Meizu when engineers in the design of the kernel have been around longer battery life on this point. And in terms of objectivity can run, because MT6755m does not belong to itself in high-end products, so there will not be too many surprises on the score. Finally put a charm blue Note3 take the same picture (click to see original image)Self portrait proofs (click to see original image)From charming blue Note3 product positioning, fingerprint identification, metal body, Netcom, 799 price are more lethal, it appears 799-999 again is filled with gunpowder. But 3G+32G charm blue Note3 itself with high version of the phone priced at 999 Yuan, and blue Metal charm with company\'s products there seems to be a competitive relationship. Product is also 999 Yuan, charming blue Note3 has more memory and storage capacity, and network support with Netcom, and blue Metal charm with more powerful SoC, this choice will allow consumers to tangle. Contrasting Note3 charm blue and other brand products, its price is higher, more testing on it and compare, we will introduce in the subsequent evaluation.TipsMicro sweep sweep, author tips bar -30 votesCharming Blue-Note 3\rNote3 charm blue fuselage, from international manufacturers in hot pursuit of the 6000 series of aircraft-grade aluminum-magnesium alloy, with advanced anode oxidation process, creating a charming blue amazing extraordinary tactile Note3. 2.5D front panel interface with metal body skillfully and seamlessly, and more streamlined, gives charm blue Note3 minimalist and elegant visual style.\rView details of the voting >> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Ah8RAVZyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Ah8RAVZyo)
