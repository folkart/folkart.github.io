The message said, Microsoft is testing new software, using methods of the built-in Android emulator application Win10 phones running Android, and with the launch of Win10 in the second half, all Win10 will be fully compatible Android applications.

However, the rumored Microsoft has never formally confirmed or denied.[![Alt GUCCI case for iphone 6 plus](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/gucci_i6case_i6p253_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nixcase.com/gucci-iphone-6-plus-case-cover-with-golden-frame-black-p-10094.html)Then Windows 10-compatible Android applications rely on unreliable? Microsoft will really take this strategy?Ecological construction of compatible Android on Windows would be counterproductiveApplication software is too less, update is too slow Microsoft\'s ecosystem has been difficult to establish the biggest problems, both the desktop side of the Modern UI app store or mobile WP mobile application stores, there are the problem. By means of compatible Android applications to quickly solve the problem of lack of application. Therefore, Microsoft if you think this is also understandable.In fact, similar to the situation with Microsoft BlackBerry was the first to adopt such a policy. Two months ago, BlackBerry for BlackBerry 10 operating system upgrade, all BlackBerry smartphones are compatible with the Android application. However, the BlackBerry, this initiative also announced its move in ecological competition defeat. BlackBerry this initiative can solve the problem of lack of application software for a short time, but their construction did not play a role in promoting ecosystem and instead will encounter some problems. Microsoft adopted this policy, also will encounter some problems.First will face legal problems if Google Play Win10 phone simulators run native apps, and nothing has changed in the Windows, Google could take them to court.In addition, Fusion Android and WP will also bring experience problems. Because Android application design specifications, operating logic and WP is completely different, Android application click on the slide as a supplement, and contrary to WP in order to slide the click as a supplement. In the native Android applications ported to WP system, due to the different design styles and inconsistent actions, will bring vision and experience problems. Plus is the use of Simulator runs Android application, will also affect equipment performance issues when running the application.And compatible Android applications may not be able to please those loyal users of WP, for some users, select left WP is a fancy it differs from Android and iOS, ready to accept WP application preparation. If WP run Android applications on the device, will certainly not native Android devices a good experience, so why don\'t they just switched to the Android platform, but experience awkward Android application in WP.But the biggest problem is that the strategy could backfire, accelerated developers away from the Windows environment. Microsoft introduced Android application like Homestead because Android has a very complete, needs to develop WP can be replenished, but was arrested on the lack of application of WP will never turn into vacancy. This change is the Microsoft developers will be further away from the vicious circle, and even switched to the Android ecosystem, rather than continue to serve the development and application of Win10. And the end result may be the WP mobile phone will become a puppet of the Android, and Microsoft\'s ecosystem will remain flat, even shrinking.Microsoft is not aware of these problems, according to Microsoft sources, Android analog plans still in advance, but Microsoft hasn\'t decided whether it will be integrated into the Win10 on the phone.Windows cross-platform development tool or Microsoft reconstruction ecological opportunitiesHowever, Microsoft has never given up reconstructing ecological idea of Windows, compatible with Android application may be it is a programme of the planned, another solution is to provide cross-platform development tool to dig Android and iOS developers \"laid\".Last year, Microsoft began to explore this approach. In last year\'s TechEd Conference, Apache Cordova announced the adoption of open source platforms for Microsoft Visual Studio development tools, the tool allows developers to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript language to develop some moving mixed-platform applications, these applications can support WP, Android and iOS the three major mobile platforms. In addition, also recently spread that Microsoft will acquire Xamarin company news. Xamarin.Mobile the company\'s cross-platform development framework allows developers to use c # to develop native Android, iOS, and Windows applications.Compared to analog compatible Android applications, \"cross-platform\" has more advantages, also have the ability to help Microsoft Windows ecosystem reconstruction.First of all, based on cross-platform development tools with just one developer applications can be ported to WP store and Google Play and on the App Store, not only at the same time expanded to the three major mobile platforms, and greatly reduce the development cost and time, which has great appeal to developers. In addition, Win10 is a cross-operating system of the Terminal itself, it extends across PCs, devices such as tablet computers and smart phones, Xbox One, could bring tens of millions of users on different terminals, cross-platform application developers will not only launch, will jointly launch Terminal application.For consumers, the application platform, seamlessly connect across terminals can also bring experience improvement. For example, play games or work with files in the Metro, home computer or other equipment could continue to handle mobile games or file.In addition, due to the current iOS development tools are fairly advanced, Google is also gradually perfecting the Android Studio, and they scraped most of mobile market share, Apple and Google won\'t do something cross-platform. However, this is Microsoft\'s opportunity.If Microsoft is to rebuild the Windows ecosystem providing competitive cross-platform development tool is the best policy. Win10 compatible Android applications are symptoms, not the causes, although can ease the Windows lack of ecological problems for a short time, but on Windows it will have the opposite effect of ecological construction, Microsoft should not have taken such a dubious strategy. But after the Nadela to run, Microsoft has taken a series of radical openness strategy, finally would take would not say which way.![Alt Windows 10-compatible Android applications rely on unreliable?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1663/25574088536_491b257522.jpg)365 votesGoPro Hero4 Black\rView details of the voting >>
