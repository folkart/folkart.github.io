If you fly regularly, you know that, passengers at the airport, but most of the time is spent waiting and the party, outside besides the annoyance of passengers, it also caused flight congestion and fuel waste. Now, researchers have developed a computer model to achieve more efficient passenger and aircraft movements.

Computer model after the variables are integrated to help air traffic controllers decide when to let the plane take off and when to keep the plane in the gate.![Alt Tired of waiting at the airport?

Early in 2007, Hamsa Balakrishnan\'s research team in the United States of Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport study in plane mode. The research team found that the congestion at the airport there will be 10% to 20% time. For example, a plane waiting for the runway at Newark International Airport for the 52-minutes long.　　Researchers used computer models to test the real historical data from 2007 to 2010, test results show that it is able to accurately predict the length of queue error of plus or minus about two planes. Researchers hope that air traffic controllers can eventually use this algorithm to predict the outcome of an aircraft issued certain instructions are, like other aircraft waiting to take off, and overall delays, and so on.　　Hamsa Balakrishnan said, \"If you predict the next 15 minutes, only 10 planes can take off, that would not be necessary, since the gate release 25 aircraft. The end result is that you need to find the right needs to release the number of planes to ensure that will not result in more congestion on the ground, and there is no idle. ” [Marcelo Burlon iPhone 6+](http://www.trendbee.com/shop-men-department-0-color-0-store-24-brand-15891-tag-0-all-size-0-page-1-trendbee-marcelo-burlon-county-of-milan)　　It is understood that this computer model is actually very easy to implement, the research team\'s next move will be to test it in other airports across the country. Aviation authorities are expected, in the next couple of years, United States appears more serious congestion at the airport, and this model is the best way to solve this problem.[![Alt Marcelo Burlon iPhone plus](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/marcelo_burlon_i6p1905_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/marcelo-burlon-iphone-6-plus-case-wolf-black-p-4765.html)　　At present, the results of this study have been published in the journal transportation science.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology , The Internet
