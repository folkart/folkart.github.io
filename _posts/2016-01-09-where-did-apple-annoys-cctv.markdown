![Alt Where did Apple annoys CCTV?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1628/24260421455_9d7e4fd1eb_m.jpg)Micro signal to public accounts com \"wisdom teeth\". In this article the author made 315 view CCTV Gala to Apple last spring, CCTV itself and is not a conflict of interest, but the Cook tried to push Apple to have close relations with China.[![Alt Hello Kitty iphone 6 plus](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/hello_kitty_i6p801_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/hello-kitty-silicone-iphone-6-plus-case-with-pearl-pendant-pink-p-4360.html)The most controversial point is the question author: 315 evening exposure after Apple, will likely mean cheaper version of the iPhone was aborted and, ultimately, the other in China negotiations settled as soon as possible.315 evening exposure Apple yesterday after sale problems led to an uproar, and deeply attached to Twitter \"about 8:20\", this has become a new popular phrases.There is no doubt that everyone knew the CCTV blaming Apple is intentional. But why should this be? For Apple, \"for 315 on the money they can make you\" does not seem to be the problem. Apple to do the whole subject of media in China have no current ads are cooperative marketing agencies and operators invested – operator was television customers.So advertising is not the problem with Apple, then Apple\'s what is the problem?![Alt Where did Apple annoys CCTV?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1448/24152278192_7445f2fb64_z.jpg)In fact the first time I heard about 315 to Apple two weeks ago, around February 25 and 26th, sources from Microsoft sales people in China, said \"may, may not, have yet to be fully determined.\"I said I knew the story, but 100% is not guaranteed to be true and well documented, the story dating back to Apple CEO Tim Cook in two visits to China in the past year. More like a retreat for the first time, in addition to visiting Apple on each of the vendors, and most importantly, is meeting with top government officials.Alleged that Cook had met with leaders at the highest level. No one that which an exchange of views on both sides. But then Apple\'s move in China worth pondering.First of all, Apple started out media publish a large number of China-related news, which caused excitement of Chinese science and technology blog, then passed to more conventional public opinion of media and media authority within the system.Then, Apple\'s global research and Development Center in Shanghai. This happened not long ago by television media. A research and Development Center building construction site worker said: \"we have confidentiality agreements with Apple, I can\'t tell you who it was to build. ”Then, users found the path to overseas after the App Store\'s bandwidth has increased--and of course seems to oscillate. But overall, now from the App Store updates faster than a year ago. Is associated with it, and every now and then some \"rumors\" server that made the Apple App Store in China.Finally, it was Cook\'s second visit to China. This trip much more transparent, and everyone knew cook with miit Minister, Miao Wei, meet to talk about China Mobile\'s problems. And then Apple related press releases are under stress for Apple\'s contribution to the development of the Chinese market.So what\'s the conclusion?That 315 possible Apple after I had targeted to collect a small range of perspectives, restore the plot is this:Apple\'s activities in China\'s demand and China\'s demand for Apple is not an exact match. Cook for their own purposes, you need to make concessions.Cook\'s purpose and cannot be determined, speculated that there may be set up a full subject of legal entities in China, full operation in China\'s research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and marketing. At present, Apple is still in China by authorizing powers to run.If he wants to achieve this objective, he was presented to the following requirements:A settlement Center in China, to the Chinese Government and directly addressing a certain number of jobs. Set up research and development centers in China, China technology, training technical personnel. Cooperation with the Chinese operators, particularly the support and promotion of China Mobile\'s TD-series network communications standard. China to set up the server and accept the regulator\'s control.As far as I know, 1TH and 2nd Cook has agreed and began to perform. Problem on the 3rd and 4th.Cooperation with China Mobile on iPhone, Cook was in fact intentional. According to anecdotal information from China Mobile, the next-generation iPhone will support the TD-SCDMA standard and TDD-LTE, run by China Mobile this version of iPhone sales and the Internet.But that version on iPhone mobile has additional requirements. In three major ways:Subsidies will be less than China Mobile to give Apple Unicom operate iPhone subsidies. China Mobile did not hope to experience losses about a year like China Unicom began to take iPhone relaunched. In view of the size and attributes of the TD network users, China Mobile\'s hope Apple can customize cheap, less than $ 200 iPhone, to move a large stable of 2G users. Technical details of Apple\'s servers in China and Apple does not match the rule. This does not have to elaborate on this.Apple is not willing to pay the cost to implement the above three points, Apple\'s worry is that if this precedent is set. Apple\'s own product systems and operational rules would be China\'s huge purchasing power is down. Apple will eventually lose the original, on the global industrial chain advantages of full control.Due to the needs and concerns on both sides of the Apple event in China is not in direct conflict, so it has been open to negotiation.From January to March, the details of the negotiations have been unknown. But it wasn\'t until the end of February, the message \"could not agree\", with 315 to Apple rumors. [iPhone 6 plus cases hello kitty](http://michaelkors2015.tumblr.com/post/135171265630/global-foundries-and-manufacturers-in-amds)So the truth is likely to be two weeks ago, seeing the last bet before the cards, are maneuvering not 315, talk about failing, you\'ll have to use it as a weapon.315 against Apple, the interests behind the chain is too complex, and Apple\'s competitors such as Samsung and is not relevant. , Including China Mobile and industrial system of the whole country, are small shows power to Apple. So no matter what, Apple is not immune to the past. [Hello Kitty iphone 6 plus](http://www.nodcase.com/hello-kitty-silicone-iphone-6-plus-case-with-pearl-pendant-pink-p-4360.html)Of course, as everyone expected, the company could not hide. 315 of the outgoing signal, cheaper iPhone at least, Apple is certainly did not take into account--this is the original Apple product and brand systems most proposals. Capitalists know hundreds of years ago poured milk into a river, not on sale, Apple is not so foolish as to that extent.While the rest of the negotiations may be completed soon. Server and clearing problems Apple has nothing to talk about. Rules for overseas science and technology enterprises in China, do not allow Apple to open a special case.If both parties are playing cards when signing is to shake hands. 315, but hand on the last card. In China it is imperative, but the bargaining process, needs 315 party draw to an end.——————————————————————About wisdom teeth: micro-public accounts of wisdom teeth, you can search \"zhi_chi\" Add or scan the QR code below.
