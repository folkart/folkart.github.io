Now most of the POS machine supported card, supports \"Flash\" cards as in previous similar brushes bus card in the POS machine can detect the card, in accordance with the payment amount and can achieve a small \"no password\" payments or pay offline card after entering the password.[![Alt Jack Spade iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/jack_spade_ip4216_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/jack-spade-iphone-5-case-grid-black-p-3622.html) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3uZz0UBYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3uZz0UBYs) ![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1548/25819376156_63c53ca89c.jpg)And Apple Pay is bound in the phone your credit card machines after their NFC antennas and POS communication, so as to replace the functions of a credit card. In the credit card through the phone\'s NFC and calibration Touch ID (equivalent to entering a password) and then complete the payment. Although looks very high tech, but as long as the manufacturers and acquirers of banks reached an agreement has little difficulty.Samsung Pay:![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1711/25724492652_3f79f44a21_z.jpg)Apple and Samsung are the enemies, you have Apple Pay me a Samsung to Pay, as Samsung and Apple use the NFC does not use the virtual magnetic strip technology (MST,Magnetic Secure Transmission).![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1506/25218849353_435ac4d8d1_b.jpg)Samsung\'s current flagship model (S6 edge+, S6, such as edge, Note 5) have built-in can be fired \"magnetic bar code\" coil, mobile phones can impersonate a bank card with a magnetic strip credit card operations. Which means I can phone \"disguise\" into a bank card with a magnetic strip, and \"cheat\" POS machines, thought I was a card. And Apple Pay have to pay different POS support NFC, its advantage is that you can not replace the existing POS directly using this technique (but now a growing number of POS support NFC, while supporting the NFC but due to Visa and Master of EMC standard and China UnionPay PBOC 2.0 technologies are not compatible, so far if spread is Samsung Pay more ease of use at home).China UnionPay Flash: [Jack Spade iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/jack-spade-iphone-5-case-grid-black-p-3622.html)![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1517/25724506472_fb5387459e.jpg)China UnionPay Flash (QuickPass), can also be a fast payment, outside two support, VISA and Master Card (NFC) payment, the Union created its own standard--PBOC 2.0. Apply Pay in the United States use of NFC payment standard is based on the EMC standards for VISA, China UnionPay Flash is used by PBOC 2.0 technology developed by, and are not compatible with each other. It is also iPhone6s and Hong Kong version iPhone6s NFC chip models are not the same and the reasons for not yet support Apple Pay. Of course, China UnionPay has also pilot some after Union certification of NFC mobile phone Flash Bank and China UnionPay-bound, uses mobile NFC simulation support QuickPass offline bank card payments.Micro-payments and PayPal:![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1666/25544750500_da191445f8_z.jpg)Micro-payments and PayPal scanning code to pay with these instruments emerges from the hardware standard is because it is difficult to, as previously introduced, due to various reasons, had to bypass a special hardware requirements, for payment. So was born the app scans QR payment, and supermarkets scanned bar code, dynamic binding personal account user is presented with QR codes (equal to the product of the \"bar code\"), and the barcode/QR code binds the user\'s bank card account, as long as the cashier can enter the debit amount automatic deductions from a bank card agreement.When it comes to end, it boils down to in the field of mobile payments, settlement institution for the various manufacturers are also good night, has its own wishful thinking, hope to use their system so that it better control, and charge credit card fees (even if the app also charge a fee to pay), and settlement institutions for a long time can play. Of course, in any case, to provide consumers with the convenience of paying is a good way to improve our life, as they tore that\'s their thing.Tips [Jack Spade iPhone 5 Case](http://milled.com/jackspadeny/hB0xPhais1I_mP1w)![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1702/25214941574_2d534533c1.jpg)Micro sweep sweep, author tips bar -![Alt \rOPPO R9 spring fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1601/25218877493_d325d3e22f.jpg)3694 people votedApple Watch\rBut Apple Watch after a few days I feel, watch the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Interaction on the watch is not only faster and less bother than phone to social, Apple Watch has another hidden benefit: it than phones are less likely to indulge in.\r In such a small screen, you can\'t do anything, so I don\'t have that feeling of being sucked and they get lost in electronic equipment. To me, that\'s the biggest difference between Apple Watch and mobile phone. Until now, Apple Watch is pure business, aim is purely to improve productivity. For some users, this point may be worth hundreds of dollars in price.\rView details of the voting >>
