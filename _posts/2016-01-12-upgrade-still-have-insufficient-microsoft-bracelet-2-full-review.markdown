Although the light is always concealed by Surface Book and Lumia 950/950 XL, but this smart-wearable devices becoming more and more popular today, Microsoft\'s second generation smart band is very notable. Bracelet recognized early Microsoft is powerful, but apart from that all aspects of the experience was poor. After a return to practice, more slim and beautiful bracelet second-generation Microsoft finally came.　　On the second generation of Microsoft\'s bracelet, we reported on its hands-on experience, but of course it is not enough. Nearly a month after the launch, let us take a look at the detailed experience:　　Display![Alt Upgrade still have insufficient Microsoft bracelet 2 full review](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1675/23698634014_d7e7046420_b.jpg)　　First bracelet the most criticized part of Microsoft is it stiff and uncomfortable design defects caused the culprit is heavy and flat display screens.　　New Microsoft hand ring focused on improving this, the integration of a curved screen, make it better fit your wrist, make it easier to read the notice.　　Second generation of Microsoft\'s bracelet has 3 equipped with Corning Gorilla glass AMOLED screen. Screen size than larger, 32x12.8mm, 320x128 resolution, pixel density of 255 PPI. In contrast, early product data for 33x11mm,320x106 resolution, 247 PPI.　　Screen is bigger, but far more significant, after all, the screen and the watch is indeed small. Unless the side-by-side comparison of the two generations of products, or you can hardly notice.　　It is worth mentioning that, the second generation of Microsoft\'s bracelet display image pixel texture is more obvious than generation products. Although this is not a big problem, after all, you just to see the text of notice, but it is very clear.　　If the problem is not in the above, the second generation of Microsoft\'s bracelet\'s screen will still give you a good impression. Picture bright vivid colors, incredibly pretty and electricity-saving.　　Design![Alt Upgrade still have insufficient Microsoft bracelet 2 full review](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1534/24031265730_37d8c55027_b.jpg)　　Frankly the appearance of the first generation of Microsoft bracelet does not look good. Microsoft may be trying to use all black color scheme to create a cool feeling, but finally got a mediocre design.　　Abandoning the original plastic, the second generation of Microsoft\'s Bracelet using silver metal. It\'s just a small change, but did increase the face value. But to be honest, Microsoft hand ring from \"beautiful\" is also not small distances, especially when you find the second than the first generation still take some time.　　New Microsoft bracelet strap is known as thermoplastic elastomers made by silicone, can bring to the skin soft and smooth feel. In addition, this material is more durable.

Many people complained that the original product the strap deterioration over time will soon appear, but the second generation products using the new strap is to have solved this problem.　　Side of the bracelet is the Home keys and action keys as part of metal tables are made of brushed silver material. Than the first generation, both key touch resistance now, easier to press down.　　Second generation Microsoft wrist strap buckles have also been big change, it became larger, with a metallic silver color scheme, and easy to adjust position. UV sensor and charging port built into the strap buckle, show Microsoft\'s focus on product details.　　Comfort![Alt Upgrade still have insufficient Microsoft bracelet 2 full review](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1633/24326862145_52418ceef1_b.jpg)　　As we all know, the original Microsoft bracelet comfort experience is very bad, especially when you are typing, that heavy feeling you have to take it off. Even if put on smaller versions, you won\'t feel much better.　　Many people thought that Microsoft\'s second generation product completely solved the problem, but this is not the case.　　Second generation of Microsoft\'s bracelet has a softer strap and curved screens, said that to a certain extent improved the experience. However, because the screen gets larger, it becomes very difficult to find a suitable tightness. A little bit tight, feeling the blood had been stopped; if loosely hung wrist and a chain.　　Of course, different people same wearable device may have a completely different experience. Microsoft bracelet on the wrist of a fault in other people may not be existing.　　Bracelet sizes![Alt Upgrade still have insufficient Microsoft bracelet 2 full review](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1550/23959053009_64986759d1_b.jpg)　　Original Microsoft bracelets feature itself is powerful enough, so on the second generation of smaller improvements. Bracelets with these second-generation Microsoft components: the heart rate sensor, three-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, ambient light sensor, temperature sensor, UV sensor, capacitance sensor, a microphone, a galvanic skin response sensor, there are new barometers.　　Powerful configuration means you can get through it very much information. By barometer, that now when you can climb altitude.　　Roughly the same configuration, but the layout has changed. Microphones and pressure gauge on the side of the bracelet, touch heart rate and galvanic skin response sensor is below the dial, strap buckle is ultraviolet sensors, such as GPS and accelerometer is buried in the deepest place.　　As with the first generation of products, the new Microsoft hand ring is not completely waterproof, but basically there are waterproof and dustproof features. It can stay under water for 30 minutes of the one-meter-deep, but does not recommend it.　　Lack of adequate waterproofing capacity did a little disappointed, but read the altitude than new features to be more practical. If you particularly like with a bracelet to go swimming or boating, bracelets that Microsoft really is not well suited.Click on the next exciting continue[Article correction]12 next pageCollection is the collection of 1542Tags: gadgets\r Science and technology DesignIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
